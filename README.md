Create a simple calculator which can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication or division depending upon the user input.


        iented and Procedural paradigms.

So as a summary, why you need both the header file and the namespace to run a simple c++ program, because computer needs to know the definition of the code of the functionalities. It is defined in the header file. So header file needs to be included. namespace is needed because if a functionalities like cout is used, but not defined in the current scope computer needs to know where to check. so namespace needs to be included. Because we are writing the code outside the std namespace.


A function in Python is an aggregation of related statements designed to perform a computational, logical, or evaluative task. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done task together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call the function to reuse code contained in it over and over again.
